- **MVVM + MVI**: To achieve clarity and flexibility in design, we combine the principles of MVVM and MVI patterns, providing efficient state management and user interaction.

- **Hilt**: We employ Hilt, a powerful dependency injection tool from Google, to ensure ease of dependency management and inversion of control in our project.
