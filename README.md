<summary>For the convenience of the developer we added tools like Firebase crashlytics, Timber, LeakCanary, and 
setup Ktlint and Detekt for folowing code-quality. And also add most useful Github actions. 
After every successful build you will recive apk-file in Telegram-bot, or you can change this function,

  concerns and ease of maintenance and scalability of the codebase.

- **MVI**: To achieve clarity and flexibility in design, we combine the principles of MVVM and MVI
  patterns, providing efficient state management and user interaction.

- **Hilt**: We employ Hilt, a powerful dependency injection tool from Google, to ensure ease of
  dependency management and inversion of control in our project.
